# ObjectiveAI Scripts

Read `README.md` for documentation on existing scripts.

## Guidelines

- Document every new script in `README.md` with a description, usage, and examples
- Scripts should be bash (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`) with `set -euo pipefail`
- Validate arguments and print usage on incorrect invocation
- Keep scripts focused — one task per script
